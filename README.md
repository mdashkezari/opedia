Opedia is an open source database service to integrate, visualize, and analyze ocean datasets such as satellite data, in-situ observations, and model outputs. The project is supported by [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/).

# Documentation
https://cmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

# System Requirements
* [Anaconda Distribution Pyhton 3.7 -- 2.7](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
* Make sure python is in system path.

# Installation
1.  **Set up database drivers (only required on macOS).**<br>
	 install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/); a package manager for macOS.<br>
	 ODBC driver provides the connection to the Opedia database.

	```
	$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
	$ brew install unixodbc freetds ffmpeg
	```

	ffmpeg package is used to generate video contents.
	

2. **Install [Python Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).**<br>
Make sure python is added to the system path.  Anaconda distribution covers the majority of python modules used by Opedia. Finally pip-install the opedia package itself.

	```
	$ pip install opedia
	```

3. **Need to update opedia?**<br>
Both the python distribution and opedia are actively being developed, so it can be useful to update them every now and often. Using an older version of opedia with the latest python, or vice versa, may lead to errors for example.

	```
	$ sudo pip install opedia --upgrade
	```
